    <p>Our understanding of the landscape around us does not only come from what we see with our gaze. It is much more than that. Physical embodiement and narratives are as important. That is why I will emerge myself for the complete length of the zero meter altitude line into the hypothetical new coast line of the Netherlands in the case of persistant global warming impacts.
            <br><br>
            The Netherlands consists of a complex system of waterbodies and has many different water narratives. During the first weeks I found out that looking is not enough, you have to listen to all the stories to understand the complete intenglement the Dutch have with the water. It is a story about fighting against, with and for the water. There are places that once were land, then turned into sea, then back into land again and all the stages in between.
