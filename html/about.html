        <h6> Me </h6>
        <p>
            With a background in landscape architecture, Maud’s starting point is the human engagements in our direct environment. She carefully observes the mutual exchanges happening in the human-environmental interface. With the observations as starting point, Maud’s projects consider our place on Earth in the context of social and climatological change through the usage of extensive bodily performances and a variety of digital media, including web-development and film. In the installations that follow the research and direct engagement process, Maud’s work stage intimate, heroic and speculative engagements between people and their direct environments.
