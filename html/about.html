        <h6> Me </h6>
        <p>
            Ever since I was little I was interested in a broad range of topics. From the humanities to the ecological from the technical to the artistic. This manifests itself in my career choices, my works and the themes I am dealing with. <br><br>
            
            In my works I am exploring the self in relation to the environment. How do we perceive what is arround us? How do we use surroundings? What effects does a space have on us? <br><br>
            
            These topics are explored by technological methods like programming and electronic installations. But it is also done by implementing analogue versions of the technical. As long as the works stay exloring new perspectives on what the surrounding means to us and how it effects us.
